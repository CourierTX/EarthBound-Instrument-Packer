Opens a folder
Gathers all files with a .spc extension into a list

Dump metadata, compile metadata, or rip BRRs? (d/c/r)

Dump tags:
	Serializes header info to YML and saves it (Filepath, Song name, Game name, etc)
Compile tags:
	Looks for the YML file
	Goes to each filepath and patches in the data

Rip BRRs
	(Checks if the SPC file is compatible, stops if it's a driver that doesn't have the Sample Directory in the normal place.)
	Goes to the Sample Directory
	Creates BRR file with the right loop point
	Creates a folder with the SPC file's name and saves everything
	Goes to where the metadata is and turns it into a config.txt file
